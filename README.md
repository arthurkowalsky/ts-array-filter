# Array Where Filter

A TypeScript library that provides a simple and intuitive .where(...) method for filtering arrays based on specified filters. It includes a generic filter interface for better type checking and autocompletion.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```
npm install ts-array-filter
```

## Usage

Import the library in your TypeScript project:

```typescript
import 'ts-array-filter';
```

Declare an interface for your data:

```typescript
interface Example {
id: number;
name: string;
tags: string[];
}
```

Create a sample data array:

```typescript
const data: Example[] = [
{ id: 1, name: 'Example 1', tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'] },
{ id: 2, name: 'Example 2', tags: ['tag2', 'tag3'] },
{ id: 3, name: 'Example 3', tags: ['tag1', 'tag3'] },
];
```

Apply filters using the .where(...) method:

```typescript
const result = data.where([
{ field: 'id', operator: '>', value: 1 },
{ field: 'tags', operator: 'array-contains', value: 'tag3' },
]);
```

## Supported Filters

1. < less than
2. <= less than or equal to
3. == equal to
4. ">" greater than
5. ">=" greater than or equal to
6. != not equal to
7. array-contains
